## Skills Assessment


I endeavored to optimize simplicity and flexibility. 
Hard coding data into the HTML might have been faster as far as front end work, at the cost of ease of flexibility later when a client wants to change the list. 

I put the info into a json object and iterated the list. The drop down function cleared and re-printed the phone or email data. Not ideal in terms of javascript use, but this isn't enterprise scale. 

The row highlight option would take me a bit longer. 

I stole the dropdown code to save time. It's not as responsive as the rest of the elements. 


I need more time to sort out the click, highlight issue. 
probably at least a coffee and probably restructuring the initial setup function to made the elements hidden vs. attatching them after the fact.
